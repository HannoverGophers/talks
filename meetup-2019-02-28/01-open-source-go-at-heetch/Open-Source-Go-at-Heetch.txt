Open Source Go at Heetch
========================
https://www.heetch.com

Just the facts Ma'am:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  - French ride hailing company, based in Paris, but with a remote
    engineering work force.
  - Notionally Like Uber or MOIA, but *really* not like Uber or MOIA ;-)
  - We use Go for nearly everything, including parts of our iOS and
    Android apps.
    - There's also some Elixir, Kotlin, Swift, Javascript (of course),
      Ruby (Legacy) and Python (Data Science).
  - We believe strongly in giving back to the Go community:
    - Open Source as much as possible
    - Sponsor events:
      - Platinum sponsor for dotGo! 2019:

What do you do at Heetch?
=========================

  - I work for the Developer Care team
  - I wrote a longish blog post about what "Developer Care" is, and how
    it came to be:
    - https://eng.heetch.com/developer-care-3e22a4d7ff54
  - Short version: We build tools and libraries for product oriented
    engineers to accelerate them and build "tech credit".

SQALX
~~~~~

  Description
        sqalx (pronounced 'scale-x') is a library built on top of sqlx
        that allows to seamlessly create nested transactions and to
        avoid thinking about whether or not a function is called within
        a transaction. With sqalx you can easily create reusable and
        composable functions that can be called within or out of
        transactions and that can create transactions themselves.
  Status
        In production use
  Planned work
        None
