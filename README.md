# Meetups
Here you can find the slides/examples/etc. from the talks.

# How to create a meetup folder?
if you had a talk on one of our meetups, please left your sildes/examples here and make them available for the other members.
So create a folder named like following pattern `meetup-yyyy-MM-dd`.

# How to create a talk folder?

When you had the first talk then please create a folder with following pattern:

At the beginning you take the number of your talk and write it as a two-digit number `01`. As separator please take the `-` symbol. And at least the topic you talked about in lower case. (e.g. "Features of Golang" = `features-of-golang` )

In combination the result looks like: `01-features-of-golang`

Subfolders like `slides` or `examples` are very welcome.

Thanks!
