## Submitting a Talk

To submit a talk, [**create a new issue**](https://github.com/HannoverGophers/talks/issues/new). There we have prepared a template which you just need to fill out. After that, we will review your submission and set it as upcoming talk. If you want to add additional information like a preferred date, just add it as a new comment to your opened issue.

###### Notes:
- Before submitting, please make sure that your topic isn't covered yet by someone else in the [**issues**](https://github.com/HannoverGophers/talks/issues).
- If there is already an open issue with your topic as talk idea, please reference that issue in an extra comment.

# Meetups


## How to create a meetup folder?
if you had a talk on one of our meetups, please left your sildes/examples here and make them available for the other members.
So create a folder named like following pattern `meetup-yyyy-MM-dd`.

## How to create a talk folder?

When you had the first talk then please create a folder with following pattern:

At the beginning you take the number of your talk and write it as a two-digit number `01`. As separator please take the `-` symbol. And at least the topic you talked about in lower case. (e.g. "Features of Golang" = `features-of-golang` )

In combination the result looks like: `01-features-of-golang`

Subfolders like `slides` or `examples` are very welcome.

Thanks!
